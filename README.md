# SpeechRecognition
console application which uses the Windows speech recognition with the .net c# API to create a text-adventure type game

The idea is to have a console application where you can either type or speak the commands.
And the feedback is provided using text in the console and/or speech through the speech synthesizer

Also, I want to be able to read the XML profiles as exported by https://voiceattack.com/
because the commands and conditions in those XML profiles seem powerful enough to create an entire text adventure
